# CS 010C Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains the work completed for CS 010C Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms, a course for computer science majors. The course covers basic data structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, and queues, as well as dictionaries (including binary search trees and hashing) and priority queues (heaps). It also offers an introductory analysis of algorithms, sorting algorithms, and object-oriented programming, including abstract data types, inheritance, and polymorphism.
